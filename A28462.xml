            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>This night the Good-wife (whom His Majeſty was pleaſed to call <hi>My dame Joan)</hi> provided ſome chickens for His Majeſties ſupper, (a dainty He had not lately been acquainted with) and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pallet was put into the ſecret place for His Majeſty to reſt in; ſome of the Brothers being continually upon duty, watching the Avenues of the houſe and the Road-way, to prevent the danger of a ſurpriſe.</p>
                  <p>After ſupper Col. <hi>Carlis</hi> asked His Majeſty what meat He would pleaſe to have provided for the morrow, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> His Majeſty deſired ſome Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, if it might be had; but it was thought dangerous for <hi>William</hi> to go to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101270:34"/> any market to buy it; ſince his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours all knew he did not uſe to buy ſuch for his own dyet, and ſo it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a ſuſpicion of his having ſtrangers at his houſe; But the Colonel found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expedient to ſatisfie His Majeſties deſires; Early on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning he repairs to Mr. <hi>William Stauntons</hi> ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, who rented ſome of the Demeans of <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> here he choſe one of the beſt ſheep, ſticks him with his dagger, then ſends <hi>William</hi> for the Mutton, who brings him home on his back.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> morning <hi>(September</hi> the ſeventh) His Majeſty got up early (his dormitory being none of the beſt nor his bed the eaſieſt) and, near the ſecret place where he lay, had the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Gallery to walk in, where be was obſerved to ſpend ſome time in His <note n="*" place="margin">Pſ. 116. <hi>I have found tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and I called on the name of our Lord.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Devotions,</hi> and where he had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a window, which ſurveyed the road from <hi>Tong</hi> to <hi>Brewood;</hi> Soon after His Majeſty coming down into the Parlor, his noſe fell a bleeding, which put his poor faithful ſervants into a great fright, but his Majeſty was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoon to remove it, by telling them,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101270:35"/> It often did ſo.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Mutton was cold, <hi>William</hi> cut it up and brought a Leg of it into the Parlor; His Majeſty called for a Knife and a Trencher, and cut ſome of it into Collops and pricked them with the Knifes point, then called for a Frying-pan and butter, and fryed the Collops himſelf, of which he eat hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily; Col. <hi>Carlis</hi> the while being but Under-cook, (and that honour enough too) made the fire, and turned the Collops in the Pan.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Colonel</hi> afterwards attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed His Majeſty in <hi>France,</hi> His Majeſty calling to remembrance this paſſage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, was pleaſed merrily to propoſe it, as a Problematical Queſtion; Whether Himſelf or the Col. were the Maſter-Cook at <hi>Boſcobel;</hi> and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy was of right adjudged to His Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>All this while the other Brothers of the <hi>Penderels</hi> were in their ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either ſcouting abroad to learn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, or upon ſome other ſervice; but it ſo pleaſed God, that, though the Souldiers had ſome Intelligence of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101270:35"/> 
                     <hi>His Majeſties</hi> having been at <hi>Whitela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and none that he was gone thence, yet this houſe (which proved a happy ſanctuary for <hi>His Majesty</hi> in this ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent) had not at all been ſearched du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>His Majeſties</hi> aboad there, though that had ſeveral times; this perhaps the rather eſcaping, becauſe the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours could truly inform, none but poor ſervants lived here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Majeſty</hi> ſpent ſome part of this Lords-day in Reading in a pretty Arbour in <hi>Boſcobel</hi> garden, which grew upon a Mount, and wherein there was a ſtone Table and Seats about it; and commended the place for its retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>And having underſtood by <hi>John Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derel,</hi> that the <hi>Lord Wilmot</hi> was at Mr. <hi>Whitgreaves</hi> houſe, (for <hi>John</hi> knew not of his remove to <hi>Bentley) His Majeſty</hi> was deſirous to let my Lord hear of Him, and that He intended to come to <hi>Moſely</hi> that night.</p>
                  <p>To this end <hi>John</hi> was ſent on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning to <hi>Moſeley;</hi> But, finding my Lord removed thence, was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and then acquainted Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greave</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:101270:36"/> and Mr. <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was returned to <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> and the diſaccommodation He had there; whereupon they both reſolve to go with <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Bentley,</hi> where having gained him an acceſs to my Lord, his Lordſhip deſigned to attend the King that night at <hi>Moſeley,</hi> and deſired Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> to meet his Lordſhip at a place appointed about 12. of the Clock, and Mr. <hi>Huddleſton</hi> to nominate a place where he would attend <hi>His Majeſty</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one of the clock, the ſame night.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Intelligence my Lord made ſtay of Mrs. <hi>Jane Lane</hi>'s journey to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> till <hi>His Majeſties</hi> pleaſure was known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Penderel</hi> returned to <hi>Boſcobel</hi> in the afternoon with intimation of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned meeting with my Lord at <hi>Moſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> that night, and the place which was appointed by Mr. <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> where <hi>His Majeſty</hi> ſhould be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> having not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his late foot journey to <hi>Madeley,</hi> was not able without a horſe, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this to <hi>Moſeley,</hi> which was about five miles diſtant from <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> and near the mid-way from thence to <hi>Bentley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:101270:36"/>
                  <p> It was therefore concluded, that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> ſhould ride upon <hi>Humphrey Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derels</hi> Mill-horſe (for <hi>Humphrey</hi> was the Miller of <hi>Whiteladies</hi> Mill,) The horſe was taken up from Graſs, and accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, not with rich trappings or furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, befitting ſo great a King, but with a pittiful old Saddle and a worſe Bridle.</p>
                  <p>When His Majeſty was ready to take horſe, Col. <hi>Carlis</hi> humbly took leave of Him, being ſo well known in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that his attendance upon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would in all probability have proved rather a diſſervice than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; however his hearty prayers were not wanting for His Majeſties preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>Thus then His Majeſty was mounted, and thus he rode towards <hi>Moſeley,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by all the honeſt brothers, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, John, Richard, Humphrey,</hi> and <hi>George Penderel,</hi> and <hi>Francis Yates,</hi> each of theſe took a Bill or Pike ſtaff on his back, and ſome of them had Piſtols in their pockets; two marched before, one on each ſide His Majeſties horſe, and two came behind aloof off, their deſign
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101270:37"/> being this, that in caſe they ſhould have been queſtioned or encountered but by five or ſix Troopers or ſuch like ſmall Party, they would have ſhewed their valor in defending, as well as they had done their fidelity in otherwiſe ſerving His Majeſty: And though it was near Midnight, yet they conducted His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty through by-ways, for better Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                  <p>After ſome experience had of the horſe, His Majeſty complained, <hi>It was the heavieſt Dull Jade he ever rode on;</hi> To which <hi>Humphrey</hi> (the owner of him) Anſwered (beyond the uſual capacity of a Miller,) <hi>My Liege! Can you blame the horſe to go heavily, when he has the weight of three Kingdoms on his back?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When His Majeſty <hi>came to Penford Mill,</hi> within two miles of Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaves</hi> houſe, His Guides deſired Him to alight and goe on foot the reſt of the way, for more ſecurity, the Foot-way being the more ſecure and the nearer, and at laſt they arrived at the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Mr. <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> (which was a little grove of trees in a Cloſe of Mr. <hi>Whitgreaves</hi> called the <hi>Pit-leaſow,)</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:101270:37"/> in order to his Majeſties being private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed into Mr. <hi>Whitgreaves</hi> houſe; <hi>William, Humphrey</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the horſe, the other three at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended His Majeſty to the Houſe; but His Majeſty, being gone a little way, had forgot (it ſeems) to bid Farewel to <hi>William</hi> and the reſt, who were going back, ſo He called to them and ſaid, <hi>My troubles make me forget my ſelf, I thank you all,</hi> and gave them his hand to kiſs.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> in purſuance of his own appointment; came to the meeting-place preciſely at his hour, where Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> received him and conveyed him to his old chamber; but hearing nothing of the King at his prefixed time, gave occaſion to ſuſpect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Munday after noon Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greave</hi> had notice that ſome Souldiers were in the neighborhood, intending to apprehend him, upon information that he had been at <hi>Worceſter</hi> Fight: The <hi>King</hi> was then laid down upon Mr. <hi>Huddleſtons</hi> bed, but Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> preſently ſecures his <hi>Royal Guest</hi> in the ſecret place, and my Lord alſo, leaves open all the Chamber doors, and goes boldly down to the Souldiers, aſſuring them (as his Neighbours alſo teſtified) that he not been from home in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night

                  <p>Being come to <hi>Whiteladies,</hi> on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> they called for Mr. <hi>George Giffard,</hi> who lived in an appartiment of the houſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a Piſtol to his breaſt, and bad him confeſs where the <hi>King</hi> was, or he ſhould preſently die; Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> was too loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and too much a Gentleman to be fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into any infidelity, reſolutely denies the knowing any more, but that divers Cavaliers came thither on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> night, eat up their proviſion and departed, and

                  <p>THe <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of this <hi>Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Hiſtory</hi> I long ſince pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, having the means to be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in all circumſtances relating to it; The <hi>Scene</hi> (whereon thoſe great <hi>Actions</hi> were performed) being my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Comntrey, and many of the <hi>Actors</hi> my particular Friends.</p>
                  <p>I did not then intend to have proceeded farther, preſuming ſome of thoſe worthy Perſons of the Weſt (who were the happy Inſtruments in this <hi>Second Part)</hi> would have given us that ſo much deſired ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement; The rather ſince the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wonderful ſeries of this <hi>great Work,</hi> wherein the hand of God ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly

                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 24.</note> wuſt needs open the eyes and convert the hearts of the moſt diſloyal.</p>
                  <p>But finding, in all this time, nothing done, and the world more greedy of it, than ever young Ladies were to read the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of an amorous ſtrange Romance, after they had left the darling Lover plunged into ſome dire misfortune; I have thus endeavoured to compleat the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cheifly encourag'd hereunto, by an <hi>Expreſs</hi> from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> wherein 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that (beſides the tranſlation of the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of <hi>Boſcobel</hi> into <hi>French)</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Giffard</hi> of <hi>Whiteladies</hi> has lately made it ſpeake <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and preſented it to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> our moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Queen,</hi> who was pleaſed to accept it with Grace, and peruſe it with Paſſion; intimating her <hi>Royal deſire</hi> to ſee the particulars, how the hand of Providence
<pb facs="tcp:101270:51"/> bad led the <hi>great Monarch of her heart</hi> out of the treacherous ſnares of ſo many Rebels.</p>
                  <p>In this, I dare not undertake to deliver ſo many particulars, as in the former; for though the time of <hi>His Majeſties</hi> ſtay in thoſe Weſtern parts was longer, yet the places were more remote, and my <hi>Lord Wilmot</hi> the principal Agent) dead: But I will again confidently promiſe to write nothing but truth, as near as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſcrutiny can inform me.</p>
                  <p>And perhaps a leſs exactneſs in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials will better pleaſe ſome, who (as I have heard) object againſt my former endeavours on this Royal Subject as too minutely written and particulars ſet down of too mean a concern, for which I have yet the example of that renowned Hiſtorian <note place="margin">De Bello Belgico.</note> 
                     <hi>Famian Strada</hi> to protect me, who wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Emperor <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> mentions what meat he fed on ſuch a day, what cloaths he wore another time, and
<pb facs="tcp:101270:52"/> gives this reaſon; <hi>That it pleaſes, to know every thing</hi> that <hi>Princes do:</hi> Eſpecially when by a chain of Providences, whoſe every Link ſeems ſmall and weak in its ſingle ſelf, ſo great a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> will, at laſt, be drawn in among us. <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 17.</note>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Symons</hi> in the time of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Gueſts, did by chance let fall an Oath, for which Mr. <hi>Jackson</hi> took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion modeſtly to reprove him.</p>

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101270:66"/> was therefore diſmis'd with thanks, for the ſervice he had done, and His <hi>Majeſty</hi> held on his journey without any ſtay, and being come to <hi>Bramber</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeven miles of the deſir'd <hi>Port,</hi> met there ſome of Colonel <hi>Herbert Morleys</hi> Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who yet did neither examine, nor had they, as far as could be diſcerned, the leaſt ſuſpition of the Royal Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who arrived at laſt at the <hi>George</hi> Inn in <hi>Brighthamſton,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Manſel,</hi> (who aſſiſted Colonel <hi>Gunter</hi> in this happy ſervice, had agreed to meet him.)</p>

His Majeſties Journey from thence to the houſe of Colonel <hi>Francis Wyndham</hi> at <hi>Trent</hi> in the ſame County,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101270:75"/> his Stay there, his Endeaour (though fruſtrate) to get over into <hi>France,</hi> his Return to <hi>Trent,</hi> his final Departure thence in order to his happy Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, are the ſubject of this preſent Relation. A Story, in which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations of Providence are ſo refulgent, that their light is ſufficient to confute all the Atheiſts of the world, and to enforce all perſons (whoſe faculties are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly depraved) to acknowledge a watchful Eye of GOD from above, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon all Actions of Men here below, making even the moſt wicked, ſubſervient to his juſt and glorious deſigns. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, whatſoever the Antients fabled of <hi>Gyges's</hi> Ring, by which he could render himſelf Inviſible, or the Poets fancied of their Gods, who uſually carried their chief Favourites in the Clouds, and by drawing thoſe aerial Curtains, did ſo conceal them, that they were heard and ſeen of none, whilſt they both heard and ſaw others, is here moſt certainly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. For, the Almighty ſo cloſely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veed the King, with the wing of his Protection, and ſo clouded the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his cruel Enemies, that the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101270:75"/> moſt piercing Eye of malice could not ſee, nor the moſt Barbarouſly-bloody Hand offer Violence to his Sacred Perſon: God ſmiting his purſuers (as once he did the <hi>Sodomites)</hi> with blindneſs, who with as much eagerneſs ſought to ſacrifice the Lords Anointed to their fury, as the other did to proſtitute the Angels to their luſt.</p>
                  <p>But before the ſeveral Particulars of this Story are laid open, two Queſtions (eaſily foreſeen) which will be readily asked by every Reader, call for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The one is, Why this Relation ſo much expected, ſo much longed for, has been kept up all this while from publick veiw? And the other, How it comes to paſs, that now it takes the liberty to walk abroad? Concerning the firſt, it muſt be known, that a Narrative of theſe Paſſages was (by eſpecial command frnm his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty) written by the Colonels own hand, immediately after the Kings return into <hi>England;</hi> which (being preſented to his Majeſty) was laid up in his Royal Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, there to reſt for ſome time, it being the Kings pleaſure (for reaſons beſt known to his Sacred ſelf) that it ſhould not then be publiſhed.</p>

                  <p> And as his Majeſties command to keep it private, is a ſatisfactory anſwer to the firſt; ſo, his licence now obtained that it might travel abroad, may ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the ſecond queſtion. But beſides this, many prevalent reaſons there are, which plead for a publication; the chief of which are briefly theſe. That the implacable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of this Crown may be for ever ſilenced and aſhamed; who having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law, nor Religion to patronize their unjuſt undertakings, conſtrued a bare Permiſſion, to be a Divine Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their Actions; and (taking the Almighty to be ſuch a one as themſelves) blaſphemouſly entitled God to be the Author of all their wickedneſs. But the arm of God ſtretched out from heaven to the reſcue of the King, cutting off the clue of their Succeſs, even then when they thought they had ſpun up their thred, hath not left them ſo much as an apron of fig-leaves to cover the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their moſt ſhameful proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The next is, That the Truth of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Eſcape (being minced by ſome, miſtaken by others, and not fully ſet forth by any) might appear in its native

His Majeſty having received this intelligence concerning the Colonel, together with an exact information of the ſcituation of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſought an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſpeak with Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> (from whom the better to conceal himſelf, he then kept at a diſtance) and by means of Mr. <hi>Laſſels</hi> (who accompanied the King in this journey) obtaining his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Lordſhip was not in the leaſt altered, except a Hawk on his fiſt, and a Lure by his ſide might paſs for a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. This Confidence of his Lordſhip really begat admiration in the Colonel, calling to mind the great danger he was in, and whoſe Harbinger he was; For he advertiſed the Colonel, that the King himſelf was on his way to <hi>Trent,</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that very night to lodge at <hi>Caſtle-Cary</hi> (a Town ſix miles thence) hoping by Gods aſſiſtance to be with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten of the clock next morning.</p>
                  <p>At this joyful news the Colonel was tranſported, (there having run a report, that his Majeſty was ſlain in the Fight at <hi>Worceſter)</hi> and giving God thanks for his wonderful mercy, he aſſured his Lordſhip, <hi>That for his Majeſties preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation he would value neither his life, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily nor fortune, and would never injure His Majeſties confidence of him; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that God who had led His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty through the midſt of ſuch inexpreſſible dangers, would deliver him from all thoſe</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:101270:81"/> 
                     <hi>barbarous threats, and bloody intentions of his Enemies.</hi> With theſe and ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, the Colonel brought the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> into his parlour, where he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an exact account of His Majeſties condition and preſent affairs.</p>
                  <p>Next morning, the Colonel found it neceſſary to acquaint the Lady <hi>Wyndham</hi> his mother, and alſo his own Lady, with the particulars the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night imparted to him, concerning the King. The relation he gave them, did not (through the weakneſs of their ſex) bring upon them any womaniſh paſſion, but ſurprized with joy, they moſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſolve (without the leaſt ſhew of fear) to hazard all, for the ſafety of the King. And ſo (begging Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon their future endeavours) they contrive how his Majeſty might be brought into the houſe, without any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition to their family, conſiſting of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty perſons. Among them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Mrs. <hi>Julian Coningsby</hi> (the Lady <hi>Wyndham's</hi> Neece) <hi>Elianor Withers, Joan Halſenoth,</hi> and <hi>Henry Peters</hi> (whoſe loyalty to the King, and fidelity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they had ſufficiently experienced)
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101270:81"/> are made privy to their deſign. Next they conſider what Chambers are fitteſt for his Majeſties rception. Four are made choice of; amongſt which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>Wyndham</hi>'s was counted moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the day-time, where the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants might wait with moſt freedom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Majeſty. Then a ſafe place is provided to retreat unto, in caſe of ſearch, or imminent danger: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Employments are deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all others out of the way at the inſtant of his Majeſties arrival. All which after a while, anſwered their deſires, even beyond their expectation.</p>
                  <p>Between nine and ten the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Colonel and his Lady walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the fields adjoining to the houſe, eſpied the King riding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Laſſels</hi> in their company. Aſſoon as his Majeſty came near the Colonel, He called to him, <hi>Frank, Frank, how doſt thou do?</hi> By which gracious pleaſance the Colonel perceived, that though his Majeſties ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and countenance were much chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged yet his Heroick ſpirit was the ſame, and his mind immutable. The Colonel
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101270:82"/> (to avoid the jealous eyes of ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) inſtantly conveyed the King and Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi> into the Lady <hi>Wyndham's</hi> Chamber, where the paſſions of Joy and Sorrow did a while combat in them, who beheld his Sacred Perſon. For what loyal Eye could look upon ſo Glorious a Prince thus eclipſed, and not pay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the homage of tears? But the conſideration of his Majeſties ſafety, the gracious words of his own mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the ſad reports of his untimely death, together with the hope of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture preſervation, ſoon dried them up. In a ſhort time the Colonel brought the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> to the King, and then the Ladies withdrew into the Parlour, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt agreed to call Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi> Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, and to entertain her with the ſame familiarity as if ſhe had been their near Relation. That day ſhe ſtayed at <hi>Trent,</hi> and the next morning early Mr. <hi>Laſſels</hi> and ſhe departed.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty, after he had refreſhed himſelf, commanded the Colonel in the preſence of the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, What way he thought moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable for his Eſcape into <hi>France;</hi> for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101270:82"/> thither he deſired with all ſpeed to be tranſported. The Colonel (the King giving him this opportunity) entertained and encouraged his Majeſty with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage of Sir <hi>Thomas Windham</hi> (his Father) <hi>Who, not long before his death [in the Year</hi> 1636] <hi>called unto him his five Sons, (having not ſeen them together in ſome years before) and diſcourſed unto us</hi> [ſaid he] <hi>of the loving Peace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity this Kingdom had enjoyed under its Three laſt Glorious Monarchs: Of the many Miſeries and Calamities which lay ſore upon our Anceſtors, by the ſeveral Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Conqueſts of Forein Nations, and likewiſe by Inteſtine Inſurrections and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions. And notwithſtanding the ſtrange mutations and Changes in</hi> England, <hi>He ſhewed, how it pleaſed God in love to our Nation to preſerve an undoubted Succeſſion of Kings, to ſit in the Regal Throne. He mentioned the healing Conjunction of the two Houſes of</hi> York <hi>and</hi> Lancaſter, <hi>and the bleſſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the two Crowns of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>ſtopping up thoſe fountains of Blood, which, by National feuds and quarrels kept open, had like to have drowned the whole Iſland.

Theſe words being ſpoken with much earneſtneſs, both in geſture and manner extraordinary, he aroſe from his chair, and left us in a deep conſultation what the meaning ſhould be of—</hi>The Crown hanging upon a Buſh. <hi>Theſe words, Sir,</hi> (ſaid the Colonel) <hi>made ſo firm an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in all our breaſts, that the many afflictions of theſe ſad Times cannot raze out their undelible characters. Certainly theſe are the days which my Father pointed out in that Expreſſion: and I doubt not, God hath brought me through ſo many dangers, that I might ſhew my ſelf both a dutiful Son, and a loyal Subject, in faithfully endeavouring to ſerve your Sacred Majeſty, in this your greateſt Diſtreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:101270:83"/>
                  <p> After this Rehearſal, the Colonel (in obedience to His Majeſties command) told the King, That Sir <hi>John Strangways</hi> (who had given many teſtimonies of his loyalty, having two Sons, both of them Colonels for his Royal Father) lived but four miles from <hi>Trent;</hi> That he was a perſon of great fortune and intereſt in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and therefore he ſuppoſed that either Sir <hi>John,</hi> or his Sons might be ſervicable to His Majeſty's occaſions. The King, in proſecution of this propoſal, commanded the Colonel to wait on them; and accordingly the next morning he went over to <hi>Melbury;</hi> the place where Sir <hi>John</hi> dwelt. No ſooner was he come thither, but he met with Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Giles Strangways,</hi> and after uſual ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations, they walked inio the Park ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to the houſe, where Colonel <hi>Wyndham</hi> imparted the reaſon and end of his preſent Viſit. Colonel <hi>Strangways</hi> his anſwer was, That he was infinitly grieved, becauſe he was not able to ſerve His Majeſty in procuring a Veſſel accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to expectation; That he knew not any one Maſter of a Ship, or ſo much as one Mariner that he could truſt: All
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101270:84"/> that were formerly of his acquaintance in <hi>Weymouth,</hi> being for their loyalty baniſhed, and gone beyond the ſea; and in <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Lime</hi> he was a meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, having not one Confident in either. A hundred pounds in Gold he delivered to Colonel <hi>Wyndham,</hi> to preſent to the King; which at his return, by command was depoſited in the hands of the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> for his Majeſties uſe.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Forces under <hi>Cromwell</hi> were retreated from <hi>Worceſter</hi> into the ſeveral Quarters of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; ſome of which coming to <hi>Trent,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Overthrow of the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the Death of the King, giving out that he was certainly killed; And one of them affirmed that he ſaw him dead, and that he was buried among the reſt of the ſlain, no injury being offered to his body, becauſe he was a Valiant Soldier, and a Gallant man. This wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come News ſo tickled the Sectaries, that they could not hold from expreſſing their joy by making Bonfiers, firing of Guns, Drinking, and other jollities, And for a cloſe of all, to the Church they muſt, and there ring the Kings knell.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101270:84"/> Theſe rude Extravagancies moved not His Majeſty at all, but only (as if he were more troubled for their madneſs, than his own misfortune) to this moſt Chriſtian and compaſſionate Expreſſion, <hi>Alas poor people!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now though the King valued not the menaces of his proud Enemies, being confident they could do him no hurt; yet he neglected not to try the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Friends to convey him out of their reach. Thus the former deſign proving unſucceſsful, and all hope of Transfretation that way being laid aſide, the Colonel acquainted His Majeſty, that one Captain <hi>William Elleſden</hi> of <hi>Lime</hi> (formerly well known unto him) with his Brother <hi>John Elleſden,</hi> (by means of Colonel <hi>Bullen Reymes</hi> of <hi>Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire)</hi> had conveyed over into <hi>France,</hi> Sir <hi>John Berkley</hi> (afterward Lord <hi>Berkley)</hi> in a time of danger. To this Captain therefore His Majeſty ſends the Colonel, who lodging at his houſe in <hi>Lime,</hi> took an opportunity to tell him. That the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> had made his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from <hi>Worceſter;</hi> that he lay private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near to him; and that his Lordſhip
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101270:85"/> had earneſtly ſolicited him to uſe his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to ſecure him from the hands of the purſuers. To this purpoſe he was come to town, and aſſured the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if he would joyn in this affair, his courteſie ſhould never be forgotten. The Captain very cordially embraced the motion, and went with the Colonel to <hi>Charmouth</hi> (a little place near <hi>Lime)</hi> where at an Inn, he brought to him a Tenant of his, one <hi>Stephen Limbry,</hi> aſſuring the Colonel that he was a right honeſt man, and a perfect Royaliſt. With this <hi>Limbry</hi> Colonel <hi>Wyndham</hi> treated under the name of Captain <hi>Norris,</hi> and agreed with him to tranſport himſelf and three or four friends into <hi>France.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their Agreement were; That before the two and twentieth day of that inſtant <hi>September, Limbry</hi> ſhould bring his Veſſel into <hi>Charmou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>-Road,</hi> and on the ſaid two and twentieth, in the night ſhould receive the Colonel and his company into his Long-boat from the Beach near <hi>Charmouth,</hi> from thence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them to his Ship, and ſo land them ſafe in <hi>France.</hi> This the Colonel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured <hi>Limbry</hi> to perform with all ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101270:85"/> becauſe all the Paſſengers were of the Royal party, and intended to be ſhipped without leave, to avoid ſuch Oaths and Engagements, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be forced upon them: And therefore Privacie in this tranſaction would free him from Danger, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Trouble, the true cauſe why they ſo earneſty thirſted (for ſome time) to leave their native Country. <hi>Limbry's</hi> Salary was Sixty pounds, which the Captain engaged to pay at his return from <hi>France,</hi> upon ſight of a Certificate under the Paſſengers hands of their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. To the performance of theſe Covenants, <hi>Limbry</hi> with many vows and proteſtations obliging himſelf, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel with much ſatisfaction, and ſpeed came back to his Majeſty and the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> who at the narration of theſe paſſages expreſſed no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs being thus far ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laid, the King conſults how it might be prudentially managed, that ſo there might be no miſcarriage in the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neceſſary it was that his Majeſty and all his Attendants (contrary to the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101270:86"/> uſe of Tavellers) ſhould ſit up all the night in the Inn at <hi>Charmouth;</hi> that they ought to have the command of the houſe, to go in and out at pleaſure, the Tide not ſerving till twelve at night. To remove therefore all ſuſpicion and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, this Expedient was found out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry Peters</hi> (Colonel <hi>Windham's</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) was ſent to <hi>Charmouth</hi> Inn, who inviting the Hoſteſs to drink a glaſs of wine, told her, That he ſerved a very gallant Maſter, who had long moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately loved a Lady in <hi>Devon,</hi> and had the happineſs to be well beloved by her; and though her Equal in birth and fortune, yet ſo unequal was his fate, that by no means could he obtain her Friends conſent: And therefore it was agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that he ſhould carry her thence, and marry her among his own Allies. And for this purpoſe his Maſter had ſent him to deſire her to keep the beſt Chambers for him, intending to be at her houſe upon the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day of that month in the evening; where he reſolved not to lodge, but only to refreſh himſelf and friends, and ſo travel on either that night, or very early
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101270:86"/> next morning. With this Love-ſtory (thus contrived and acted) together with a Perſent delivered by <hi>Peters</hi> from his Maſter, the Hoſteſs was ſo well pleaſed, that ſhe promiſed him, her houſe and ſervants ſhould be at his Maſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. All which ſhe very juſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>When the day appointed for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties journey to <hi>Charmouth</hi> was come, he was pleaſed to ride before Mrs <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Coningsby</hi> (the Lady <hi>Wyndham's</hi> Neece) as formerly before Mrs. <hi>Lane:</hi> The Colonel was His Majeſties Guide, whilſt the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> with <hi>Peters</hi> kept at a convenient diſtance, that they might not ſeem to be all of one company.</p>
                  <p>In this manner travelling, they were timely met by Captain <hi>Eleſden,</hi> and by him conducted to a private houſe of his Brothers among the hills near <hi>Charmouth.</hi> There His Majeſty was pleaſed to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf to the Captain, and to give him a piece of forein Gold, in which in his ſolitary hours he made a hole to put a ribbon in. Many like pieces His Majeſty vouchſafed the Colonel and his Lady, to be kept as Records of His
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101270:87"/> Majeſties favour, and of their own fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to his moſt Sacred Perſon in the day of his greateſt Trial. All which they have moſt thankfully treaſured up as the chiefeſt Jewels of their Family.</p>
                  <p>This Royal Company from thence came to the Inn at <hi>Charmouth,</hi> a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter night; where Captain <hi>Eleſden</hi> ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaging to ſee the Maſter of the ſhip ready, (the wind blowing then fair for <hi>France)</hi> took leave of his Majeſty. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hour after came <hi>Limbry</hi> to the Inn, and aſſured the Colonel all things were prepared, and that about midnight his Long-boat ſhould wait at the place appointed. The ſet hour drawing nigh, the Colonel with <hi>Peters</hi> went to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide (leaving His Majeſty and the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> in a poſture to come away upon call) where they remained all night ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting; but ſeeing no Long-boat, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearing any meſſage from the Maſter of the ſhip, at the break of day the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel returns to the Inn, and beſeeches the King and the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> to haſte from thence. His Majeſty was intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>When the King was gone, the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> ſent <hi>Peters</hi> into <hi>Lime,</hi> to demand of Captain <hi>Eleſden</hi> the reaſon why <hi>Limbry</hi> broke his promiſe, and forfeited his word? He ſeemed much ſurpriſed with this meſſage, and ſaid, He knew no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, except it being Fair-day the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were drunk in taking their Farewell; and withall adviſed his Lordſhip to be gone, becauſe his ſtay there could not be ſafe.

                  <p>That according to an Agreement made at <hi>Charmouth, September</hi> the 19. 1651. betwixt himſelf and one Captain <hi>Norris,</hi> (ſince known to be Colonel <hi>Francis Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi> he put forth his Ship beyond the <hi>Cobs-mouth</hi> into <hi>Charmouth-road,</hi> where his ſervants on the 22. of the ſame moneth were all ready in her, waiting his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; That he going to his houſe about ten that night, for linen to carry with him, was unexpectedly locked into a chamber by his Wife, to whom he had a little before revealed his intended Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age

                  <p>Thus a Deſign in a buſineſs of the high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101270:88"/> nature, carried on with induſtry and prudence, even to the very laſt, ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing full hope of a happy production, by one mans ſingle whiſper (the bane of Action) proved abortive. For no doubt, had <hi>Limbry</hi> kept his counſel, he had gained the honour of Conveying over his Majeſty; of whoſe Noble Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Vertue, God was pleaſed to make yet farther trial, as the ſequel will inform.</p>
                  <p>The King paſſing on upon <hi>London-Road</hi> from <hi>Charmouth,</hi> met many travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, among whom was one of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſervants, well known both to His Majeſty and the Colonel; who were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well pleaſed that he was not guilty of ſo much Civility, as to give either of them the complement of a Salutation. As they drew near to <hi>Bridport,</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel riding a little before, and entring the town, perceived it full of Soldiers: whereupon ſtopping his horſe till the King came up, he inreated His Majeſty to keep on, and by no means to put himſelf into the mouth of them, who gaped gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily after his deſtruction. Nevertheleſs, the King having engaged to the Lord
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101270:89"/> 
                     <hi>Wilmot</hi> to expect him there, (without the leaſt apprehenſion of danger) rode into the <hi>George,</hi> and alighting in the Court, was forced to ſtay there, and in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, near half an hour, before the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel could procure a Chamber. All this while his bloody Enemies were his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Companions, with whom he diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freely without fear, and learned from them their intended Voyage for <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey,</hi> and their Deſign upon thoſe Iſlands. Here may you ſee the Purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers overtaken, and the bittereſt of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies friendly diſcourſing with Him, whoſe utter Ruine they accounted would compleat their Happineſs. He that ſate in Heaven certainly laughed them to ſcorn, and by the interpoſition of his mighty Arm eclipſed their glory, and by his admirable Wiſdom reproved and confuted their malice againſt the King, and their blaſphemies againſt Heaven.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner had the King withdrawn himſelf from this dangerous Company in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Chamber (with much difficulty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) but Mrs. <hi>Coningsby</hi> eſpied <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> riding into the Inn. He (being beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up) acquainted His Majeſty, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101270:89"/> the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> humbly petitioned him to make haſte out of that place, and to overtake him ſlowly paſſing on the road, and waiting his Majeſties coming. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon the diſmiſſion of <hi>Peters,</hi> the King having taken ſome ſmall repaſt, not far from the Town joyned in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany again with the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> and diſcourſing of the ſeveral Adventures of that hopeful, and (as it fell out) moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Journey, concluded that <hi>London-Road</hi> was very unſafe, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow the next Turning which might probably lead towards <hi>Yeavill</hi> or <hi>Sherborn,</hi> neither of which is computed to be above two miles diſtant from <hi>Trent.</hi> Providence (the beſt of Guides) direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Strangers (for ſo they were all to thoſe parts) to a way, which after many hours travel brought them into a Village, in which was a ſmall Inn for entertainment. Thus entred theſe maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued Travellers, to enquire where they were. And to this purpoſe calling for ſome Beer, the Hoſt of the houſe (one <hi>Rice Jones)</hi> came forth, and informed them that the place was called <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winſor.</hi> The Colonel knew the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101270:90"/> and his wife to be very honeſt, loyal perſons, and that for their fidelity to the King and his party, they had (according to their condition) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone their ſhare of troubles. The King underſtanding the affection of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, reſolves to lodge in the houſe that night, it being already ſomewhat dark, and His Majeſty and Company ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wearied with their former nights watching, and that days travel. The Colonel (while the horſes were put up) deſired Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to ſhew him the moſt private rooms; the reaſon he gave was, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Brother-in-law Colonel <hi>Reymes</hi> (whom the Lord <hi>Willmot</hi> perſonated) had been a long time impriſoned as well as himſelf; That they had lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Paroles, and to be ſeen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo far from their homes, might create new jealouſies, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruſh them with new troubles. The good Hoſt upon this brought them up into the higheſt chambers, where Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateneſs recompenſed the meanneſs of the Accommodation, and the pleaſantneſs of the Hoſt (a merry fellow) allayed and mitigated the wearineſs of the Gueſts.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101270:90"/> Now the face of things began to ſmile, which all the day and night preceding looked ſo louring and ill-favoured. But this ſhort Calm was on a ſudden inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by a violent Storm. For in comes the Conſtable with almoſt Forty Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be billeted that very night in the Inn: All the lower Receptacles were thronged up with this unexpected Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; ſo that the King was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner beſieged, there being no paſſage from above, but through thoſe ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Guards. Thus every place brought forth its troubles, and every period of time diſcloſed freſh dangers! Shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Soldiers had taken up their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, a Woman in their company fell in labour in the Kitchin. The pangs ſhe endured, made the Inhabitants of that place very ill at eaſe, fearing leſt the whole Pariſh ſhould become the reputed Father, and be enforced to keep the Child. To avoid this charge, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of the Pariſh poſt to the Inn, between whom and the Soldiers aroſe a very hot conflict concerning proviſion to be made for the mother and the infant. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute continued till ſuch time as (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101270:91"/> to orders) they were to march to the Sea-ſide. This quarrelſom Goſſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping was a moſt ſeaſonable diverſion, exerciſing the minds of thoſe troubleſom Fellows, who otherwiſe were likely to have proved too too inquiſitive after the Gueſts in the houſe; the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of which, every loyal heart trembles to think on.</p>
                  <p>Surely we cannot, (except we wilfully ſhut our own eyes) but clearly ſee, and with all reverence and thankfulneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Divine Goodneſs for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſignal Deliverances in this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Eſpecially if looking back upon <hi>Charmouth,</hi> we conſider the dangers that threatned him, occaonſied by the Lord <hi>Wilmot's</hi> ſhort ſtay there, after the Kings departure. For one <hi>Hamnet</hi> a Smith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to ſhoe his Lordſhips horſe, ſaid, He well knew by the faſhion of the ſhoes, that they were never ſet in the Weſt, but in the North. The Hoſtler (a bird of the ſame feather) hearing this, began to tell what Company had been there, how they ſate up, and kept their horſes ſadled all the night; and from hence they conclude, That either the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101270:91"/> King, or ſome Great Perſons had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been at the Inn. The Hoſtler (whoſe heart was ſoured againſt the King) runs preſently to one <hi>Weſtly</hi> (of the ſame lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) then Miniſter of <hi>Charmouth,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of theſe Paſſages, and to ask counſel what was to be done. This <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> was at his Morning Exerciſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething long-winded <hi>[And by the way it may be obſerved, that long Prayers proceeding from a Traiterous heart, once did good, but by accident onely]</hi> the Hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, unwilling to loſe his reward at the Gentlemans taking horſe, returns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing his errand. As ſoon as my Lord was mounted and gone, <hi>Hamnet</hi> tells <hi>Weſtly</hi> of the diſcourſe between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Hoſtler. Away comes <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> upon full ſpeed to the Inn, and (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of breath) asks the woman of the houſe, what Gueſts ſhe had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that night? She ſaid, They were all ſtrangers to her, ſhe knew them not. I tell you then (ſaid he) one of them was the King. Then haſtily turning away from her, he and <hi>Hamnet</hi> ran to Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> of <hi>Commer</hi> (then Juſtice of Peace) to have him diſpatch abroad his Warrants
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101270:92"/> to raiſe the Country for the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the King, and thoſe perſons the laſt night with him at <hi>Charmouth.</hi> But he ſpends his mouth in vain, a deaf ear is turned upon him, no Warrant would be iſſued forth. This check given to his zeal ſo vexed him, that it had like to have cauſed a ſuffocation, had not Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Maſſey</hi> (as errant a Hotſpur as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) given it vent, by raiſing a Party and purſuing the King upon <hi>London-Road.</hi> But God preſerved His Majeſty by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting him to <hi>Broadwinſor,</hi> whilſt <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> and his hot-mettled company outran their Prey as far as <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the report of the Kings being at <hi>Charmouth,</hi> was grown ſo common, that the Soldiers (lying in thoſe parts) ſearch'd the houſes of ſeveral Gentlemen, who were accounted Royaliſts, thinking to ſurprize him. Amongſt which, <hi>Piliſdon</hi> (the houſe of Sir <hi>Hugh Windham</hi> Uncle to Colonel <hi>Francis Windham)</hi> was twice rifled. They took the old Baronet, his Lady, Daughters, and whole Family, and ſet a Guard upon them in the Hall, whilſt they examine every corner, not ſparing either Trunk or Box. Then taking a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101270:92"/> particular view of their Priſoners, they ſeize a lovely young Lady, ſaying, ſhe was the King diſguiſed in womens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel. At length being convinced of their groſs and rude miſtake, they deſiſted from offering any farther violence to that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. And here it is much to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the ſame day the King went from <hi>Charmouth,</hi> Captain <hi>Eleſden</hi> came to <hi>Pileſdon,</hi> and enquired of Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> and his Lady for the King and Colonel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirming that they muſt needs be there.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty having with an evenneſs of ſpirit gotten through this roughpaſſage, ſafely anchored at <hi>Broadwinſor,</hi> Where at length enjoying ſome reſt, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Colonel to give his opinion what courſe was to be taken, as the face of affairs then looked. The Colonel (ſeeing Forces drawn every where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſhore) thought it very hazardous to attempt any thing more in <hi>Dorſetſhire;</hi> and therefore humbly beſought his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that he would be pleaſed to retreat to <hi>Trent:</hi> He hoped his Majeſty was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſatisfied in the fidelity of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and that he doubted not, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101270:93"/> might lie ſecurely in that Creek, till it was fair weather, and a good ſeaſon to put forth to Sea. He humbly advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that <hi>Peters</hi> might conduct the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> to Mr. <hi>Huit's</hi> houſe at the <hi>Kings-Arms</hi> in <hi>Sarum,</hi> where he and many of his friends had been ſheltered in the time of troubles. That <hi>Peters</hi> (being at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum)</hi> ſhould by a private token bring his Lordſhip to Mr. <hi>John Coventry</hi> (his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) a Perſon Noble, Wiſe, and Loyal, with whom he had kept Intelligence in order to the Kings ſervice, ever ſince his Majeſty had ſet foot in <hi>Scotland;</hi> That he was aſſured Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> would think himſelf highly honoured to correſpond in this matchleſs employment, <hi>The King's Preſervation.</hi> He deſired the Lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi> to be confident of lying concealed; And likewiſe to treat with Mr. <hi>Coventry,</hi> and by <hi>Peters</hi> to return his Majeſty an account how he found that Gentleman affected towards this ſervice.</p>
                  <p>This counſel being well reliſhed and approved, 'twas reſolved, That between <hi>Sarum</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> (lying 30 miles diſtant and better) an intercourſe ſhould be kept by truſty meſſengers, and a ſecret way
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101270:93"/> of writing, to avoid danger in caſe of interception. All things being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the King left his jovial Hoſt at <hi>Broadwindſor,</hi> and returned with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel and Mrs. <hi>Coningsby</hi> to <hi>Trent.</hi> The Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> with <hi>Peters</hi> went that night to <hi>Sherborn,</hi> and the next morning was waited on by <hi>Swan</hi> (who attended his Lordſhip to the Colonels) and that day got into <hi>Sarum;</hi> where he ſoon ſaluted Mr. <hi>Coventry,</hi> in all things fully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lordſhips expectation: And (the 25. of <hi>September) Peters</hi> was ſent back with this joyful meſſage from the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> to his Majeſty, That he doubted not (by Mr. <hi>Coventries</hi> aſſiſtance, and thoſe recommended by him) to be able in ſome ſhort time to effect his deſires.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt his Sacred Majeſty enjoys his peace at <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> (with thoſe other Worthies) is buſied at <hi>Sarum</hi> to procure its continuation, It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be impertinent ro mention a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or two, which inſerted in the midſt of the web and texture of this Story would have looked unhandſom, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a fringe may prove ornamental.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Sunday morning after the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101270:94"/> King came to <hi>Trent,</hi> a Tailor of the Pariſh informed the Colonel, That the Zealots [which ſwarmed in that place] diſcourſed overnight, that Perſons of Quality were hid in his houſe, and that they intended to ſearch and ſeiſe them; and therefore he deſired the Colonel (if any ſuch there were) to convey them thence, to avoid ſurpriſal. The Colonel (rewarding the good man for his care and kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf and family) told him, That his Kinſman (meaning the Lord <hi>Wilmot)</hi> was not private, but publick in his houſe, (for ſo his Lordſhip pleaſed to be) and that he believed he would ſhew himſelf in the Church at the time of Prayers. When the honeſt fellow was gone, the Colonel acquaints the King what paſſed between himſelf and the Tailor, and withall beſought his Majeſty to perſuade the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> to accompany him to Church, thinking by this means not only to leſſen the jealouſie, but alſo to gain the good opinion of ſome of the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who would be apt to believe, that the Colonel was rather brought to Church by my Lord, than his Lordſhip by the Colonel, who ſeldom came to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101270:94"/> that Place, ſince Faction and Rebellion had juſtled out, and kept poſſeſſion againſt Peace and Religion. He alledged moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that he ſate in an Ile diſtinct from the body of the Congregation, ſo that the Pariſhoners could not take a full view of any of his company. Theſe reaſons, joined with his Majeſties command, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with his Lordſhip; and (though he thought it a bold adventure, yet) it not only allayed the fury, but alſo took out the very ſting of thoſe waſps; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they who the laſt night talked of nothing but ſearching, began now to ſay, that <hi>Cromwell's</hi> late ſucceſs againſt the King, had made the Colonel a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.</p>
                  <p>All being now quiet about home, the Colonels Lady (under a pretence of a Viſit) goes over to <hi>Sherborn</hi> to hear what news there was abroad of the King. And towards evening, at her return, a Troop of horſe clapt privately into the town. This ſilent way of entring their Quarters, in ſo triumphant a time, gave a ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm to this careful Lady, whoſe thoughts were much troubled concerning her Royal Gueſt. A ſtop ſhe made to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101270:95"/> out what brought them thither, and whither they were bound: But not one grain of Intelligence could be procured by the moſt induſtrious enquiry. When ſhe came home, ſhe gave his Majeſty an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of many ſtories, which like fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clouds were blown about by the breath of the people, ſtriving to cover her trouble with the vail of chearfulneſs. But this the King perceiving to be rather forced than free, as at other times, was earneſt to know the cauſe of her diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure. And to ſatisfie his Majeſties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, ſhe gave him a full relation of the Troop at <hi>Sherborn:</hi> At which his Majeſty laughed moſt heartily, as if he had not been in the leaſt concerned. Yet upon a ſerious debate of the matter, the Colonel and his Lady ſupplicated the King to take a view of his Privy chamber, into which he was perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to enter, but came preſently forth again, much pleaſed, that upon the leaſt approach of danger, he could thither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat with an aſſurance of ſecurity. All that night the Colonel kept ſtrict watch in his houſe, and was the more vigilant, becauſe he underſtood from <hi>Sherborn,</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:101270:95"/> that the Troop intended not to quarter there, but only to refreſh themſelves and march. And accordingly (not ſo much as looking towards <hi>Trent)</hi> about two of the clock next morning, they removed towards the Sea-coaſt. This fear being over, the King reſted all the time of his ſtay at <hi>Trent,</hi> without ſo much as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrangeneſs of which will be much increaſed by the addition of what a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain who ſerved under <hi>Cromwell</hi> at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> reported to two Divines of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted veracity, long before the King's bleſſed Reſtauration: That he was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and troubled with Dreams for three nights together, That the King was hid at <hi>Trent</hi> near <hi>Sherborn,</hi> in a houſe nigh to which ſtood a Grove or patch of trees, and that thither he ſhould go and find him. This ſuggeſtion thus reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was a powerful ſpur to prick him forwards: But the hand which held the reins and kept him back, was irreſiſtible.</p>
                  <p>Now the hands of his Majeſties enemies were not only reſtrained from doing him evil, but the hands of his friends were ſtrengthened to do him good. In order
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101270:96"/> to which, Colonel <hi>Edward Phelips</hi> of <hi>Montacute</hi> in the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> came from <hi>Sarum</hi> to his Majeſty <hi>(Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> 28.) with this intelligence, That his brother Colonel <hi>Robert Phelips</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to <hi>Southampton</hi> to procure a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, of whoſe tranſaction his Majeſty ſhould receive a ſpeedy account.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, Captain <hi>Thomas Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton</hi> (a Neighbour of Colonel <hi>Wynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi> was diſpatch'd up into <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> where by the aid of Mr. <hi>Standiſh</hi> he dealt with the Maſter of a Ship, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to carry off the Lord <hi>Wilmet</hi> and his company, upon the condition his Lordſhip would follow his direction. But the hope of Colonel <hi>Phelips</hi> his good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at <hi>Hampton</hi> daſhed this enterpriſe, and the Captain was remanded to <hi>Trent,</hi> and to make no progreſs till farther order.</p>
                  <p>Upon the firſt of <hi>October</hi> Mr. <hi>John Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liok</hi> (Chaplain to Mr. <hi>Coventry)</hi> brought a Letter to his Majeſty. In anſwer to which the King wrote back, That he deſired all diligence might be uſed in providing a Veſſel; and if it ſhould prove difficult at <hi>Hampton,</hi> trial ſhould be made farther: That they ſhould be aſcertained of a Ship
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101270:96"/> before they ſent to remove him, that ſo he might run no more hazards than what of neceſſity he muſt meet with in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from <hi>Trent</hi> to the place of his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October</hi> the fifth, Colonel <hi>Phelips</hi> came from the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coventry</hi> to his Majeſty with this aſſurance, That all things were ready; And that he had informed himſelf with the moſt private ways, that ſo he might with greater probability of ſafety guide his Majeſty to the Sea-ſide. Aſſoon as the King heard this Meſſage, He reſolved upon his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Colonel <hi>Wyndham</hi> earneſtly peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his Majeſty, that he might wait on him to the ſhore: But his Majeſty gave no grant, ſaying, It was no way neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and might prove very inconvenient. Upon the renewing this requeſt, the King commanded the contrary, but ſweetned his denial with this promiſe, That if he were put to any diſtreſs, he would again retreat to <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About ten next morning <hi>(October</hi> the ſixth) his Majeſty took leave of the old Lady <hi>Wyndham,</hi> the Colonels Lady and Family, not omitting the meaneſt of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101270:97"/> them that ſerved him. But to the good old Lady he vouchſafed more than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reſpect, who accounted it her higheſt honour, that ſhe had three Sons and one Grandchild ſlain in the defence of the Father, and that ſhe her ſelf in her old age had been inſtrumental in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Son, both Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus his Sacred Majeſty, taking Mrs. <hi>Juliana Coningsby</hi> behind him, attended by Colonel <hi>Robert Phelips,</hi> and <hi>Peters,</hi> bad Farewel to <hi>Trent,</hi> the Ark in which God ſhut him up, when the Floods of Rebellion had covered the face of his Dominions. Here he reſted Nineteen days, to give his faithful Servants time to work his deliverance: And the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty crowned their endeavours with ſucceſs, that his Majeſty might live to appear as Glorious in his Actions, as Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious in his Sufferings.</p>
